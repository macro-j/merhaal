1) Clear Trip Plan Details page (critical)

After generating a plan it shows success but details aren’t presented clearly.

Create/adjust a “Trip Plan Details” view:

Header: city, days, budget, accommodation type, interests

For each day: day title + time blocks (morning/noon/afternoon/evening) + activity cards

Each activity card: name, short description, duration, category/interest, and “Google Maps” link

After generation, navigate automatically to this details view.

2) Fix PDF export login error (must work)

Professional users still get “please login” when exporting PDF.

Ensure PDF download request always sends JWT Authorization: Bearer <token> (same token source as other authenticated calls).

Server endpoint must enforce:

tier === professional for PDF

plan belongs to the user

Free/Smart must receive 403 with clear Arabic message.

3) Ensure generation uses DB + respects inputs (core)

Prefer DB activities for the selected city.

Enforce input-driven selection:

interests strongly influence activities

accommodation type (economy/medium/luxury) affects choices (use tags/priceRange heuristic)

budget heuristic prevents expensive picks for low budgets

If DB lacks enough matches, fill remaining slots withsfallback placeholders and show a clear message suggesting admin adds more activities.

Never save an empty plan. Aim for ≥3 activities/day when data exists.

Include one accommodation recommendation per trip when tier=professional and data exists.

4) Fix AlUla image not showing

Ensure city cards always have valid image URL/path.

Add a default fallback image when missing.

5) Google Maps links

Add “عرض على خرائط Google” for each place.

If googlePlaceId exists use it; otherwise create a Google Maps search URL (name + city).

6) Professional-only “Best time to visit” (NO weather API)

Add a Professional-only label per activity/time block:

“أفضل وقت للزيارة” based on simple rules by category + time of day.

Do not require any external API.

7) Support messages → Admin inbox

Save support form submissions into DB table support_messages.

Add /admin/support to view and mark as resolved.

Output: short summary + exact files changed + manual test checklist.
