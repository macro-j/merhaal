Final mobile + UX polish (one pass). Minimal targeted changes only. No refactor, no redesign, keep current theme.

Fix ALL of the following:

A) Cities carousel on iPhone (autoplay + dots sync)
- City slider must autoplay every 3–4 seconds on iPhone/mobile.
- Autoplay pauses only while user is actively touching/dragging.
- Pagination dots must:
  - Reflect active slide correctly
  - Update on autoplay advance
  - Be clickable to jump to a slide
- Ensure no horizontal scroll and correct RTL alignment.
- Use the slider library’s official autoplay/pagination syncing if available; otherwise implement a lightweight interval/requestAnimationFrame that keeps index state in sync.

B) Login “Remember me” (تذكرني)
- Add a checkbox “تذكرني” on the login form.
- If checked: keep user logged in longer (e.g., 30 days).
- If unchecked: shorter expiry (e.g., 1 day).
- Implement by adjusting JWT/token expiry (and/or refresh token if you have it) based on the checkbox.
- Logout must clear stored auth token as usual.

C) Mobile responsiveness (Apple-like, iPhone-first)
- Make all key pages responsive on iPhone widths (375/390/430):
  /, /packages, /login, /plan-trip, /my-plans, /admin, /admin/import, /admin/support
- Sidebar must become a proper mobile drawer/sheet; must not squeeze content.
- No horizontal scrolling anywhere.
- Tap targets >= 44px, consistent spacing, consistent rounded corners, light shadows only (Apple-like feel) without changing colors.

D) Fix Admin Import overlay covering UI
- The “required columns / guide” section currently covers important UI (logout/back/buttons).
- Convert it to:
  - collapsible accordion (default collapsed) OR
  - modal opened by “عرض الأعمدة”
- Ensure it never overlays content; add bottom padding if needed.

E) Fix button “jump”/layout shift
- Two buttons currently jump/shift size/position when states change (hover/loading/disabled).
- Ensure stable button height/width and consistent padding across all states.
- Avoid font-size changes on hover; keep line-height stable.

F) Translation + RTL/LTR consistency
- Audit navbar/sidebar/admin labels and fix Arabic/English strings for consistency.
- Ensure RTL/LTR direction is correct for both languages across menus and drawers.
- Fix any remaining Arabic tanween issues if found (use "ًا" not "اً").

Output requirements:
- List exact files changed.
- Short checklist confirming each section A–F is fixed.
