Implement an admin-only Import page with built-in validation + preview, supporting BOTH CSV and Excel (.xlsx).

Goal:
- From the admin panel, I upload data files (CSV or XLSX).
- The system automatically validates/reviews them, shows preview + errors, then imports only after I confirm.

Requirements:
1) Add /admin/import page (admin-only) accessible from admin sidebar as "استيراد البيانات".
2) The page must support uploading either:
   - CSV (UTF-8) OR
   - Excel .xlsx
   for each dataset.
3) Supported datasets (3 logical tables):
   - Cities
   - Activities
   - Accommodations
4) Upload UX:
   - Provide 3 upload slots (Cities / Activities / Accommodations).
   - Each slot accepts: .csv or .xlsx
   - If .xlsx is uploaded, read the correct sheet by name:
     - "Cities", "Activities", "Accommodations"
     OR allow user to choose sheet from a dropdown if names differ.

5) Automatic validation & self-review (must run immediately after file upload, before import):
   - Validate required headers EXACTLY match expected schema per dataset.
   - Validate allowed values:
     - tier_required: free|smart|professional
     - budget_level: low|medium|high
     - best_time: morning|afternoon|evening
     - accommodations.class: economy|mid|luxury
     - booleans: TRUE/FALSE or true/false or 1/0 (normalize)
   - Validate relationships:
     - activities.city_id must exist in Cities upload OR already in DB
     - accommodations.city_id must exist in Cities upload OR already in DB
   - Validate uniqueness within the uploaded data:
     - no duplicate city_id, activity_id, accommodation_id
   - Validate minimal content quality:
     - description_ar must not be empty for Cities and Activities
   - If any validation fails:
     - show a clear Arabic error report (row number + column + reason)
     - block import

6) Preview:
   - Show a preview table (first 10 rows) per dataset.
   - Show counts: total rows, valid rows, invalid rows.

7) Import behavior:
   - Import runs only after clicking "تأكيد الاستيراد".
   - Use upsert by stable keys:
     - Cities: city_id
     - Activities: activity_id
     - Accommodations: accommodation_id
   - If exists -> update, else insert.
   - Never delete existing records.
   - Preserve Arabic text correctly.

8) Results report (after import):
   - Inserted/Updated counts per dataset
   - Any skipped rows with reasons
   - Buttons/links to view data in:
     - /admin/cities
     - /admin/activities
     - /admin/accommodations

Constraints:
- Minimal changes, no redesign
- No external APIs

Output:
- Files changed
- How to use the import feature (steps)
- Confirmation summary
