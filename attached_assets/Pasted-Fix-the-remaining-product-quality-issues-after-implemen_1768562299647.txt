Fix the remaining product-quality issues after implementing PDF export. Apply minimal, targeted changes only.

1) Arabic RTL PDF export (must work correctly)

The PDF export currently uses English fallbacks.

Replace this with proper Arabic RTL rendering.

Embed an Arabic-capable font (e.g., Noto Naskh Arabic or Amiri) in the PDF generation.

The PDF content must render Arabic text correctly and be readable:

Destination / city name

Trip duration and dates

Day titles (اليوم الأول، اليوم الثاني…)

Time blocks (صباحًا / ظهرًا / عصرًا / مساءً)

Activity names and descriptions

Accommodation recommendation section (if present)

Keep Merhaal branding/footer.

If the current PDF library has weak RTL support:

Switch to the simplest reliable approach (e.g., HTML → PDF with embedded Arabic font),

Without redesigning layout or changing content structure.

2) Tier naming consistency (NO Premium naming)

Use only one tier naming everywhere:

Database / logic tier IDs: free, smart, professional

UI / marketing label for professional: "احترافي"

Do NOT use “Premium” or “بريميوم” anywhere in the UI, text, or pricing.

Ensure the following are consistent across the app:

Pricing page tier titles

Feature lists

Dashboard tier badge

PDF export availability text

Any conditional checks or copy

3) PDF export availability (Professional only)

The “تصدير الخطة بصيغة PDF” feature must:

Be visible only to users with tier = professional

Be hidden or disabled for free and smart

Ensure backend checks enforce this (not UI-only).

4) Verification checklist (required)

Provide a short checklist confirming:

A user with tier = professional (احترافي) can export a plan as PDF.

The exported PDF displays Arabic text correctly (RTL, readable).

Users with free or smart tiers cannot see or use PDF export.

No occurrence of “Premium / بريميوم” exists anywhere in the app.
